It could even have a woven basket on the lower shelf for extra storage that would also complement the room's style."

There's a light gray sofa adorned with neutral-toned throw pillows and a beige knit blanket. Above the sofa, two round mirrors with a natural, woven frame are hung on the wall. In the corner, there's a comfortable-looking cream-colored armchair with a round ottoman, placed on top of a small shaggy rug. Next to the sofa is a tall white vase filled with feathery beige pampas grass. A round white coffee table with light wood legs sits in the center of the rug.
